# helium-node-simple-server


## With a github login Load this online gitpod server at

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/hpssjellis/helium-data-node-receive-send-for-arduino-portenta

.

##Steps:


Note: Best with a github login to use gitpod.io

1. Once the gitpod is loaded. Choose open browser  Bottom left of screen you must choose "MAKE PUBLIC" or the Helium integration can not find it.
2. Then you need to somehow open the web browser. On left "remote explorer" looks like a TV screen click the globe Which should open a web browser.
3. Copy the web browser URL and go to the helium console and put that URL into your integration uplink
4. I think that is it. The webpage should refresh every 20 seconds.
5. I watch the helium console device DEBUG panel to see when data has been sent. Then refesh the webpage
